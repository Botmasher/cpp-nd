# Welcome

- use C++ standard library containers and algorithms
- A* search for point-to-point mapping
- C++ is between hardware and higher level all over the place
    - does not protect you from dealing with the real world
    - works "very efficiently with the hardware"
    - but has "strong abstraction mechanisms"
- don't start small get an overview
- know the fundamentals, know the standard libraries
